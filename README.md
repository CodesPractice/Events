# Events in C#
This repository contains a simple and practical example demonstrating the use of events and delegates in C#.NET. It’s ideal for anyone looking to understand how events work in C# with clear and easy-to-follow code.

📁 What’s Inside

✅ Basic Event Example
Learn how to declare a delegate and an event, subscribe to the event, and raise the event to notify subscribers.

✅ Button Click Simulation
A simple Button class that raises an OnClick event when clicked, with a subscriber method that handles the event and prints a message.

📌 How to Use

Open the solution in Visual Studio or VSCode, then run the Program.cs file. The console application creates a Button object, subscribes to its OnClick event, and triggers the event by simulating a button click. You will see the event flow demonstrated through console messages.
